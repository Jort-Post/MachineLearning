## Goal, Roadmap & Timeline

### Goal

Get a deep, mathematical understanding of machine learning by the end of June 2025 and a deep, mathematical understanding of deep learning by the end of June 2026. 

### Roadmap

- Machine Learning
    - [ ] Recap Probability & Decision Theory
    - [ ] Regression
    - [ ] Classification
    - [ ] Kernels & Neural Networks
    - [ ] Probabilistic Models
    - [ ] Dimensionality Reduction
    - [ ] Advanced Topics

### Timeline

> Using: ‚ÄúPattern Recognition and Machine Learning‚Äù and ‚ÄúMachine Learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn‚Äù, every morning, 2 hours a day. All theory and exercises should be done in 5 days, the small project in 1-1.5 day(s). The big project takes the entire week and should be CV-worthy.
