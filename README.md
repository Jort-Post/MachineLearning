## Learning Machine Learning ##

Currently I'm learning as much as possible on machine learning, and after that I will do the same for Deep Learning. Here's the full [plan](https://horn-fireplace-29d.notion.site/Curriculum-1041d845f07180169826d3ef99fee074?pvs=4) I use, but keep in mind that this is still work in progress.

In the future, I might turn this into a guide.
